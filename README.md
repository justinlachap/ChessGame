# ChessGame

A functional game of chess built using Qt in the context of our final project for an OOP class (INF1015, H2021) at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

* Concepts of inheritance are used. For example, a queen inherits of the movements of both a bishop and a rook.
* Static variables were used. For example, a static varibale to count the number of instances of a king was created in order to ensure that there were no more than 2 instances of a king on one chessboard.
