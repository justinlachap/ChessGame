# ChessGame

A functional game of chess made with Qt. Completed in the context of our final project for an OOP class (INF1015, H2021) at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

* Concepts of inheritance are used. For example, a queen inherits of the movements of both a bishop and a rook.
* Virtual methods and abstract classes set the foundation for the logic of the game. For example, each chess piece has a method to determine where it can move, and this method is different depending a=on how each piece travels along the board.  
* Static variables are used. For example, a static varibale to count the number of instances of a king was created in order to ensure that there were no more than 2 instances of a king on one chessboard.
